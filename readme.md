# Eternity 2 playground

Python scripts for playing and analyzing Eternity 2 puzzle. It contains a backtracking algorithm but it is mostly for educiational purposes (writing one in C/C++ would be much more efficient).

# Patterns representation
For the main puzzle and also automatically generated variants we use same patterns. These are also generated by script to match the original patterns. Following are numerical values of the patterns for referrence.

work in progress..

1: <img src="./data/eternity2/color1.svg" height=20 width=20>

2: <img src="./data/eternity2/color2.svg" height=20>

3: <img src="./data/eternity2/color3.svg" width=20>

For patterns generation script see data\eternity2\generate_color.py .
